i.  **Share** means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that enable members of the public to access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.

Section 2 – Scope

a.  **License grant.**
    1.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
        A.  reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for NonCommercial purposes only;
        B.  produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for NonCommercial purposes only.
    2.  Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not reduce, limit, or restrict any use rights arising from Exceptions and Limitations, nor does it intend to limit uses of the Licensed Material that are permitted under applicable law or other applicable licenses.

    4.  Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never creates Adapted Material.
    5.  Downstream recipients. 
        A.  Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.
        B.  No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.
b.  **Other rights.**
    1.  Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to enable You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.
    2.  Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.
    3.  To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.

a.  **Attribution.**
    1.  If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:
        A.  retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material: 
            i.  identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);

    2.  You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.
    3.  If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.
b.  **NonCommercial.**
    You may not exercise the Licensed Rights primarily for commercial advantage or monetary compensation.

Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

a.  for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes only;
b.  if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
c.  You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.

Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability

a.  **Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so this exclusion may not apply to You.**
b.  **To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) for any special, incidental, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages arising out of this Public License or the use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.**
c.  The above disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability shall apply to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law.

Section 6 – Term and Termination

a.  This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here.
b.  If You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically. However:
    1.  if Your rights under this Public License terminate for this reason, then any all-clear offer from the Licensor to You to exercise the Licensed Rights under Section 2(a)(5)(A) is revoked, and You must stop all use of the Licensed Material and Adapted Material;
    2.  Your rights under Section 2(a)(5)(A) continue for 30 days from the date of termination. If You cure the noncompliance within that period, Your rights are reinstated, and this Public License continues in full force and effect. For the avoidance of doubt, the termination of this Public License does not reduce, limit, or restrict any use rights arising from Exceptions and Limitations, nor does it intend to limit uses of the Licensed Material that are permitted under applicable law or other applicable licenses.
c.  Sections 1, 5, 6, and 7 survive termination of this Public License.

Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions
